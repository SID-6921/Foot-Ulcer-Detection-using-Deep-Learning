# ü¶∂ Foot Ulcer Detection using Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Foot Ulcer Detection** project! This repository showcases a deep learning-based approach to detecting foot ulcers, which is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment, especially for individuals with diabetes.

## üåü Project Overview

Foot ulcers are a common complication for diabetic patients, and early detection is vital to prevent severe outcomes. This project leverages deep learning techniques to automate the detection process, improving the speed and accuracy of diagnosis.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze images and identify foot ulcers with high accuracy.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes image augmentation and normalization steps to enhance model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and executing the detection process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foot-ulcer-detection.git
cd foot-ulcer-detection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages:

```bash

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

In the notebook interface, open `Foot_Ulcer-detection.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided within the notebook to run the model and see the results.

## üìä Results and Analysis

The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis, including:
- **Model Accuracy**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Example images with detected ulcers highlighted.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model across different categories.

## üîç Model Details

### CNN Architecture:
- **Layers**: The model is built with multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling, dropout, and dense layers for classification.
- **Activation Function**: Uses ReLU activation in hidden layers and softmax for output.
- **Optimization**: Trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule to enhance convergence.

### Data Augmentation:
- **Techniques**: The dataset undergoes various augmentations like rotation, flipping, and zoom to increase robustness.
- **Normalization**: Image data is normalized to improve training efficiency and model accuracy.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Here are a few potential enhancements for the project:
